## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
   Function Declaration, Function Expression, and Arrow Function. Function declarations are hoisted, allowing you to use the function before it's defined. Expressions are NOT hoisted. Arrow functions are shorter versions of Expressions.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are used when defining a function, where as arguments are values the function receives from each parameter.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
   It is when a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function. Examples would be - Array.prototype.map and Array.prototype.filter
