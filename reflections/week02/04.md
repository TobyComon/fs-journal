## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
   having a clear visual of what you are working towards can save time in the long run so you aren't constantly planning AND adjusting things the whole time
2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
   I review the documentation we've been provided, and if I still can't resolve it, I reach out to TA's or instructors for help
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
   Making a definitive, but not too complex plan is essential for staying on schedule. Taking breaks is very important to prevent burnout, and googling things/asking for help rather than spending hours trying to figure out the problem on your own is far more efficient.
