## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
Columns are basically categories of information, rows show instances of the information contained in the table.
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
CREATE TABLE characters(
    id int NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age int,
    description VARCHAR(255)
)
3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
delete from indicates you are deleting an item or a set of items, where drop table deletes the whole table.
