## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums are strongly typed constants. YOu would use them when needing to work with integral values while using meaningful names to keep track of them easier. 
2. How can you modify an Enum?
By changing the base type and member values. The default type is an int, and the default value of an enum member is 0, so you would just declare that it is equal to some other type or number. 
3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
Could be used for defining default values of Jobs, Cars, Houses in GregsList.
