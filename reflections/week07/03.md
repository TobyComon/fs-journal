## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
UX is every interaction your site has with people who are using it. Things to consider are what you want the user to know, but also what they want to do when interacting with your site. 
2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
Some benefits are that if the user has a better experience with your site, they are FAR more likely to return, and even tell others about it. 
3. Why is the User Experience important?
UX is important because if your site is confusing, or difficult to use, then your business will likely suffer in the long run.
