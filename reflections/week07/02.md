## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

It helps others understand your code better, in case they are simply reviewing it, or if they are collaborating on the same project. 
3. How important is Code documentation and why?
I'd say it's very important so that your future self, and colleagues can easily understand the code you've written.
