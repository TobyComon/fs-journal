## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair programming is when you and another developer team up and work together on a project. The roles are the Driver, who is the one doing the typing, and the navigator, who focuses on the overall direction of the work being done. 
2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
Increased code quality. Since both are working together through writing the code, different ideas for approaching problems can come out and each dev can benefit from learning a new way of solving issues they may not have considered before. 
3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
If one or both partners are not talking through the code, nothing is really being gained. Both parties must be actively involved in the process to have any benefits.
