## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
Base64 is an encoding schema that represents binary data in text.
2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?
It increases the file size in almost all cases. Creates unnecessary work for the browser since it has to decode the base64 encoded strings first. Browsers are unable to cache base64 encoded images, meaning it will always need to get them from your server.
3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?
In the past, browsers had heavy limits on the amount of connections they could send to a server. Base64 was used a workaround for this. Today, we have http/2, which is incredibly efficient in delivering hundreds of files in one connection.
