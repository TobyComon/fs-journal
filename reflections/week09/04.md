## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?
Small data files that establish an encrypted link between a browser and a web server. The link ensures that all data passed between the two remains private. 
2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
Domain, organization, extended, single, multidomain and wildcard. 
Extended validation shows the padlock, HTTPS, business name, and business country in the address bar to diminish being mistaken for a spam website.
Organization validation verifies that you and your organization and domain validation are real.
Domain validation certificate offers a low level of encryption shown as a green padlock next to the URL in the address bar. 
Wildcard SSL certificates ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, you'll be able to use the same cert for any sub domains. 
Single Domain SSL protects only one domain.
Multi Domain or Unified Communications SSL certificates allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. 
3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?
The primary benefit is securing information between the visitor and your site. It also makes your site more trustworthy over other sites with similar content that do not have an SSL certificate.
