## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We attempted to implement Electron, but ended up scrapping it. We did end up using NightCafe which is an AI image generator. 
2. What went well so far?
We are all having a great time working on this. It's cool having the freedom to use everything we've learned to be creative and work on something that we enjoy. 
3. What would you do differently? Why?
If we had another chance, I would say that we all need to take Scrum more seriously and be way more involved with it. That would allow us to stay on track and accomplish all of the goals we set.
