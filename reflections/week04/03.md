## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
   They reduce the boilerplate around promises. They also don't break the chain limitation of chaining promises

2. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?
   the client function must be defined as async

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
   The code is much simpler to read. You can easily chain async functions, and the syntax is much more readable. Async functions make debugging easier, since it is just like synchronous code to the debugger and will actually step over the promises in the function
