> **ðŸ“– [The Fetch API](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/04-Fetch)**

## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
   Representational state transfer. When a RESTful API is called, the server transfers a representation of the state of the requested resource to the client.

2. What does Stateless mean?
   Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API, including any past GET requests for the same resource.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
   You need an identifier for the resource you are looking for, and an HTTP method for what operation you want the server to perform on that resource.
