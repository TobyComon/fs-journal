> **ðŸ“– [JavaScript Promises](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/02-Promises)**

## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
   Pending, resolved, and rejected.
2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
   You can chain multiple callbacks by attaching them to promises instead of having to pass each one

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
   .then() is called after the promise is resolved. THEN we can decide what to do with the resolved promise.

.catch() is used when the promise fails. .then() is only for resolved promises.
