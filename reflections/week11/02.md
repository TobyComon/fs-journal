## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
Primary are used for identifying items in a table. The keys must be unique and cannot be null. Foreign keys are used to reference data on another table. 
2. What is an `Alias`?
An alias is just a shorthand name that references tables. 
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
SELECT * FROM doctorsPatients dp
INNER JOIN patients p ON p.id = dp.PatientId
INNER JOIN doctors d ON d.id = dp.doctorId;
```
