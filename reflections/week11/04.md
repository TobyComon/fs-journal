## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I have learned much more in the last three months of this course than I ever have in my adult life. I really appreciate all the effort that went into creating this course. It has been extremely difficult, but also extremely rewarding. For the first time in a long time, I actually feel like I have a clear idea as to what career path I want to pursue, and am fairly confident I have the ability to make it happen. 

My concerns are that I may not be able to accomplish all of the design goals. The masonry design pattern is fairly complicated, and we didn't go over it very much. Other than that, I feel fairly confident. I plan to focus on segments of the specific features of the app and go from back end to front end so that I don't get burned out on one thing.
