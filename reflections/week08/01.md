2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
Having several high quality projects to show off the various techniques and technologies that you are capable of using
3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
I would include The Tower, and Planit since they are both good examples of managing different relationship types in a meaningful way. I'd also probably include TaskMaster and The network, after some refinement.
