## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
Unit Testing, Component Testing, and End-To-End (E2E) Testing

Unit testing allows you to test individual units of code in isolation, providing developers confidence in their code. 
Component testing, done with Component testing frameworks, allows you to test Vue components while they are mounted to the DOM while also providing access to several Vue plugins. 
E2E Testing actually covers ALL layers of your application, including front end code, and all back end services. This provides much higher confidence in your code than unit or component testing, since it coves ALL angles that a user will actually interact with your application. 
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think all methods are useful, in different ways. E2E is probably the MOST useful in large scale applications, since it covers every single level of the application. Unit testing is probably the most approachable method, and might be the only one needed if you are working on a smaller app. 
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
The 'least' useful is probably unit testing, since it seems like a slightly slower process manually writing thorough tests. I feel that it is still incredibly useful in certain scenarios, so I feel that it probably ultimately depends on your dev team and the application you are working on.
